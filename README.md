# LearnGit

This is me just learning how to use GIT with Terminal.

Basically first add the untracked files into the staging area
Now commit this files 
Now to push to github you can use push command

i referred CodeWithHarry's video for the same
There were many other commands which I learnt , i'll write them down neatly later
