# LearnGit

This is me just learning how to use GIT with Terminal.

Basically first add the untracked files into the staging area
Now commit this files 
Now to push to github you can use push command

i referred CodeWithHarry's video for the same
There were many other commands which I learnt , i'll write them down neatly later


Also I found one amazing FREE Udacity GIT tutorial course which is covering
almost every git topic in very systamatic and detailed manner.
Link -> https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123

Highly recommended. 10/10 for the course content and quality 

Though its too much old ( its from 2014) .. still it covers pretty much everything
and i think github haven't much changed since that time.
